log4j API follows a layered architecture where each layer provides different objects to perform different tasks. This layered architecture makes the design flexible and easy to extend in future.

There are two types of objects available with log4j framework.

Core Objects: These are mandatory objects of the framework. They are required to use the framework.

Support Objects: These are optional objects of the framework. They support core objects to perform additional but important tasks.

Core Objects
Core objects include the following types of objects âˆ’

Logger Object
The top-level layer is the Logger which provides the Logger object. The Logger object is responsible for capturing logging information and they are stored in a namespace hierarchy.
Layout Object
The layout layer provides objects which are used to format logging information in different styles. It provides support to appender objects before publishing logging information.

Layout objects play an important role in publishing logging information in a way that is human-readable and reusable.

Appender Object
This is a lower-level layer which provides Appender objects. The Appender object is responsible for publishing logging information to various preferred destinations such as a database, file, console, UNIX Syslog, etc.
